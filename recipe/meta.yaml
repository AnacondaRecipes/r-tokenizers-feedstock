  summary: 'Convert natural language text into tokens. Includes tokenizers for shingled n-grams,
    skip n-grams, words, word stems, sentences, paragraphs, characters, shingled characters,
    lines, tweets, Penn Treebank, regular expressions, as well as functions for counting
    characters, words, and sentences, and a function for splitting longer texts into
    separate documents, each with the same number of words.  The tokenizers have a consistent
    interface, and the package is built on the ''stringi'' and ''Rcpp'' packages for  fast
    yet correct tokenization in ''UTF-8''. '
